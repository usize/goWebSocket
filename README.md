Code Diary 2: WebSocket Protocol Implemented in Go
==================================================

I've been trying to teach myself Go, and, since I plan on using it for network programming /
distrubuted systems, I figured a nice introduction would be to try implementing the WebSocket protocol
from scratch. Reason being, it's a simple enough protocol to partially implement in a few hours; but
it requires enough rigor to make for a good tour of a language.

My plan is to video the process of writing it, and add some light narration. If you're feeling generous,
and you've noticed that I did something really non-idiomatic or inefficient please call me out on it! :)
